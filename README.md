# E-Commerce Back End

## API routes for e-commerce back-end database

This app demonstrates functionality of an e-commerce site's back-end. The server connects the user to a relational database created in SQL of products, categories, and tags. Because there is no front-end for this project, a link is included to view the API routes working in Insomnia. The API allows users to get all products, categories, and tags or individual ones by ID. There are also routes to create new products, tags, and categories as well as update and/or delete them.
